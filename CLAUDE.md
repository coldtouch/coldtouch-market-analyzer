# Coldtouch Market Analyzer — Project Context

> **Purpose:** This file gives any new Claude session instant context about the project.
> **INSTRUCTIONS FOR EVERY SESSION:**
> 1. Read this file FIRST before doing any work
> 2. At the END of each session, update: "Recent Session History", "TODO / Unfinished Work", and "Learned Patterns" sections
> 3. If a TODO item is completed, check it off `[x]` and move it to the session history
> 4. If new issues/patterns are discovered, add them to "Learned Patterns"
> 5. See also: `HANDOFF.md` for deep-dive reference (API endpoints, DB schema, Go client architecture, background jobs, in-memory caches)

## Project Overview

**Albion Online Market Analyzer** — a full-stack SaaS web app for analyzing the in-game economy of Albion Online.

- **Live site:** https://albionaitool.xyz
- **GitHub Pages mirror:** https://coldtouch.github.io/coldtouch-market-analyzer/
- **GitHub repo:** https://github.com/coldtouch/coldtouch-market-analyzer
- **Owner:** Coldtouch (yuvalvilensky@gmail.com, Discord-linked)

## Architecture

### Frontend (Vanilla SPA — no framework, no build step)
- `app.js` (~346KB, ~7,128 lines) — entire frontend logic
- `index.html` (~145KB) — all HTML structure
- `style.css` (~88KB) — custom CSS, glassmorphism dark theme
- `db.js` (~15KB) — IndexedDB wrapper for client-side price caching

### Backend (Node.js embedded in Python deploy script)
- `deploy_saas.py` (~136KB, ~3,046 lines) — contains the ENTIRE backend as a Python string + SFTP deploy logic
- **There is no separate backend.js in the repo** — it only exists on the VPS after deploy
- Express + JWT auth + SQLite + NATS + Discord bot + WebSocket + live flip detection, all in one Node process

### Game Client (Go)
- `../albiondata-client-custom/` — forked Albion Data Client
- Custom additions: chest/vault capture, GUID-based tab identification, WebSocket relay to VPS, OAuth Device Flow
- Key files: `operation_container_open.go`, `event_vault_info.go`, `event_container_items.go`, `vps_relay.go`, `device_auth.go`, `itemmap.go` (11,697 items)
- Build: `export PATH="$PATH:/c/Go/bin" && cd D:\Coding\albiondata-client-custom && go build -v ./...`

### Other Repos
- `../ao-bin-dumps/` — game data dumps (items.xml, items.json, recipes.json)

## Infrastructure

- **VPS (current):** Contabo VPS 20, **IP: 5.189.189.71**, Ubuntu, 1GB RAM + 512MB swap (migrated April 4 from DigitalOcean)
- **VPS (old):** 209.97.129.125 (DigitalOcean 1vCPU/1GB, decommission pending)
- **Domain:** albionaitool.xyz (Let's Encrypt SSL, certbot auto-renewal)
- **Systemd service:** `albion-saas` at `/opt/albion-saas/`
- **Game Server:** Europe (configurable via `GAME_SERVER` env var)
- **Deploy:** `python deploy_saas.py` — SFTP uploads backend.js + restarts service
- **NATS:** `nats://public:thenewalbiondata@nats.albion-online-data.com:24222`
- **Firewall:** UFW — ports 22 (SSH), 80 (certbot), 443 (HTTPS)

## Recent Session History

### Crafting Revamp Phase 1 (April 9, 2026 — Latest)
- Global tax rate fix: `TAX_RATE` 0.065 → 0.03 (3% market tax), added `SETUP_FEE = 0.025` (2.5% listing fee)
- Crafting profit: station fee base changed from material cost → sell price (matches Albion mechanic)
- Crafting: tax now uses TAX_RATE + SETUP_FEE = 5.5% for sell orders
- Transport: insta-sell shows "Tax (3%)", sell orders show "Tax+Setup (5.5%)", `soTax` fixed to 5.5%
- Transport route enrichment: effectiveTaxRate varies by sellMode (instant=3%, market=5.5%)
- BM journal flipper: sell order soTax corrected to 5.5%
- Portfolio: Net P/L tax estimate corrected to 5.5%
- City Compare refresh button: already existed and works correctly (Task 2 was already done)
- RRR formula verified: basePB=18 (15.25% RRR ≈ 15.2% ✓), focusPB=59 flat ✓
- CHANGELOG.md + About tab in index.html updated

### Code Tab Sessions 9-10 (April 7, 2026)

- April 3: Manual OAuth2, custom domain albionaitool.xyz

## TODO / Unfinished Work

### Immediate — In-Game Testing Required
- [ ] **Live game test of chest capture** — Go client → WS → VPS → frontend. Test GUID matching, tab names, item accuracy. If GUID matching fails, try mixed-endian byte-swap. Exe ready at `albiondata-client-custom.exe -debug`
- [ ] **Device Auth end-to-end test** — device code flow from Go client to browser approval
- [ ] **Verify negative item ID mappings** — IDs -1 to -9 are guesses, need live verification

### Short Term
- [ ] **ReadMail opcode handler** — capture sale mail notifications, auto-match to tracked loot tabs
- [ ] **Go client GitHub Releases** — automated builds via GitHub Actions

### Major New Feature — Loot Logger Viewer
- [ ] **Go client:** Port EvOtherGrabbedLoot (275), EvNewCharacter (29), EvCharacterStats (143), OpInventoryMoveItem (29)
- [ ] **Website tab:** Upload .txt files OR live data. Per-player breakdown with market values.
- [ ] **Loot Accountability Check:** Cross-reference loot log vs chest deposit → who picked up items that weren't deposited
- [ ] **Source repo:** https://github.com/coldtouch/ao-loot-logger (GPL-3.0, local: D:\Coding\ao-loot-logger\)
- [ ] **Txt format:** `timestamp_utc;looted_by__alliance;looted_by__guild;looted_by__name;item_id;item_name;quantity;looted_from__alliance;looted_from__guild;looted_from__name`

## Learned Patterns & Observations
> Accumulated knowledge from working sessions. Add new observations here.

- **VPS has 1 GB RAM** — Never load large result sets into memory. April 4 incident: 22M rows, 100% CPU for 12h, took down entire site
- **Backend is embedded in deploy_saas.py** — no separate backend.js in repo, only exists on VPS after deploy
- **Deploy via SFTP, not base64 echo** — base64 via echo truncates at ~100KB. Always use SFTP
- **`esc()` on ALL external data in innerHTML** — multiple XSS passes done, every new feature needs same treatment
- **NATS `sample_count` is NOT volume** — it's data frequency. Labeled "24h Activity" to avoid misleading users
- **Discord OAuth was painful** — passport → manual OAuth, sessions → JWT. Current stateless JWT works well, don't revert
- **Go PATH not in system PATH** — every Go command needs `export PATH="$PATH:/c/Go/bin"`
- **Vault info fires for ALL chests** — BankVaultInfo/GuildVaultInfo fire when approaching any chest. Match by GUID or use separate guild/bank vars
- **2-day cityPriceRef** (not 7-day) — more accurately reflects current market conditions
- **85% threshold for sell strategy** — if instant sell is within 15% of market listing, take the certainty
- **IndexedDB data older than 24h is auto-purged** on the frontend
- **Go client GUID matching is fragile** — falls back to sequential tab index when matching fails
- **VPS debugging: check CPU first** — don't chase symptoms (OAuth failures, timeouts). Run `ps aux | grep node` first. Multiple sessions were wasted investigating code that wasn't broken when the real issue was 100% CPU from computeSpreadStats
- **Never run destructive SQLite ops over raw SSH** — use `nohup`/`screen`. SSH timeout mid-transaction corrupted 4GB DB, lost 3.1M rows of price_averages
- **SMTP is already configured and working** — Gmail app password (yuvalvilensky4), verification emails sending
- **Git identity:** `Coldtouch <coldtouch@users.noreply.github.com>`
- **Always update 3 things after work:** CHANGELOG.md + in-website changelog in About tab (index.html) + features-grid if new feature. User had to remind about this when it was missed during Transport release

## Standard Workflow (After Any Work)
1. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with dated section
2. Add matching entry to changelog-list in `index.html` About tab
3. If new feature: add feature-card to features-grid in About tab
4. `git add` specific files, commit, push to origin/main
5. If backend changed: `python deploy_saas.py` to deploy

## Decisions Made (and Why)

| Decision | Reasoning |
|----------|-----------|
| Vanilla JS, no framework | Simple deployment, no build step, one-file frontend |
| Backend embedded in deploy script | Single `python deploy_saas.py` deploys everything |
| Stateless JWT (no sessions) | Works cross-origin (GitHub Pages + VPS) |
| Manual Discord OAuth | Passport-discord had no timeouts, caused hangs |
| WebSocket to VPS (not private NATS) | Simpler than running separate NATS for custom data |
| OAuth Device Auth for Go client | Users don't need to manually copy/paste tokens |
| Only collect items after ContainerOpen | Prevents ghost captures from zone loading |
| 2-day cityPriceRef | More accurate than 7-day for current market |
